# Infrared Search and Track With Unbalanced Optimal Transport Dynamics Regularization
Code implementing the robust principal components analysis with patched unbalanced optimal transport (RPCA + PUOT) and robust alignment by sparse and low-rank with patched unbalanced optimal transport (RASL + PUOT) algorithms for infrared search and track (IRST) from [Bertrand et al., 2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9169657).

Look at `demo_alignment.m` for an example of how to use the solvers.
